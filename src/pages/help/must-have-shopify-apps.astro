            <strong>Start with Klaviyo</strong> - Get your email marketing infrastructure
            in place first. Set up basic flows before you even launch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Judge.me immediately</strong> - Even if you have no reviews
            yet, having the system in place means you'll start collecting them from
            your first sales.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Install EasyEdit before launch</strong> - Don't wait until

            <strong>Add ReConvert and PageFly when needed</strong> - These are powerful
            optimization tools, but you can add them once you have some baseline
            traffic and sales.

                Important Note on App Costs
              </h3>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                While apps cost money, they're investments that pay for
                themselves many times over. A store earning $10,000/month can
                easily justify $200-300/month in apps if they're driving growth
                and saving time. Start with free plans and upgrade as you grow.

        <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Building a successful Shopify store isn't just about having great
          products - it's about having the right tools to market them, build
          trust, and provide excellent customer experiences. These five apps
          (plus EasyEdit!) form the foundation of a professional, scalable
          e-commerce operation.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Remember: the best app stack is one that you'll actually use. Start
          simple, master each tool, and add more as your business grows. Your
          future self will thank you for setting up these systems early.
